# COMP556 Project 1 - Ping-Pong Client/Server

## Team Members

1. **Aathmika Neelakanta (S01469766)** - Responsible for Client development and measurement tasks.
2. **Bo Sung Kim(S01361291)** - Responsible for Client development and measurement tasks.
3. **Tzuhan Su(S01469920)** - Responsible for Server development.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Ping-Pong Client and Server to measure the network's performance by transmitting messages of various sizes. The Client sends ping messages to the Server, and the Server responds with pong messages without modifying the content. The Client measures the latency of each exchange and calculates the average latency.

## Responsibilities

- **Client Development**: 
  - Aathmika and Bo Sung were responsible for developing the client-side of the application, including the implementation of the ping-pong message exchanges and measurement of latency.
  
- **Server Development**: 
  - Tzuhan and Jingke was responsible for developing the server-side of the application, handling multiple concurrent connections and responding to client messages, preparing the Makefile, testing the project on cloud, packaging the project.
